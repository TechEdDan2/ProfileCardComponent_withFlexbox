## My process
I didn't really have a formal process that I followed, I just used decomposition to try to break the project into its parts. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got more practice with layout and design which is always helpful. 

### Continued development

I am not sure if my layout is the best. I used the transform Y property on the image to move it to the "correct" spot, and then used negative top margine to move the main text. I think I would need to learn a more efficient way to do this because I see this could have problems in the future.
